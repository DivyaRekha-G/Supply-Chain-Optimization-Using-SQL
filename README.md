# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Using-SQL
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain operations using SQL. It involves analyzing inventory, demand forecasting, and logistics management to improve efficiency.
📂 Dataset & Tables

The project uses five key tables:

Products – Product details (ID, Name, Category, Price)

Warehouses – Warehouse locations

Inventory – Stock levels per product and warehouse

Orders – Customer orders and status

Shipments – Logistics tracking (shipment dates and status)

🎯 Key Objectives & SQL Queries

1️⃣ Inventory & Stock Analysis

Identify low-stock products and optimize reordering.

Track total stock levels per product and warehouse.

Identify out-of-stock products to prevent lost sales.

2️⃣ Demand Forecasting

Find top-selling products using order and shipment data.

Analyze monthly sales and shipping trends to forecast demand.

Automate reordering when stock falls below a threshold.

3️⃣ Shipment & Logistics Analysis

Identify delayed shipments (shipped but not delivered within 7 days).

Calculate average delivery time per warehouse.

Track warehouse efficiency based on shipments processed.

🛠 SQL Techniques Used

✅ Data Cleaning & Aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE)
✅ Inventory & Order Analysis (JOINs, Subqueries)
✅ Demand Forecasting (Window Functions, CTEs)
✅ Automated Reordering (Stored Procedures, Triggers)
